Tutorials
=========

Small datasets and two batches
------------------------------

A very simple use case with DISCERN and two batches can be found in this :doc:`Tutorial <tutorial_two_batch>`.
It is recommended to start with this tutorial, when using DISCERN the first time.
An interactive version can be found in `Tutorial.ipynb <https://github.com/imsb-uke/discern/blob/main/tutorials/Tutorial.ipynb>`_.


Multiple-batch reconstruction
-----------------------------

An application with DISCERN and multiple batches based on the pancreas dataset can be found in this :doc:`Tutorial <tutorial_multibatch>`.
This will explain how to use DISCERN with for larger datasets using multiple batches and how to access the effect of different reference batches.
The interactive version can be found in `Tutorial-MultiBatch.ipynb <https://github.com/imsb-uke/discern/blob/main/tutorials/Tutorial-MultiBatch.ipynb>`_.
